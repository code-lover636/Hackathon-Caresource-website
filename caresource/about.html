        <p>Care source is a project by students of Model Engineering College, Thrikkakara that aims to help those in need for food by providing them much needed philantrophic help.

            Our aim is to bridge the gap between those who have excess food at their homes, and those who are in need of the above mentioned food.
            
            Donors can donate the food by logging on to our website, and giving their contact information, location, and amount of available food so that our volunteers can reach them.
            
            Volunteers can use the volunteers login to access the contact information of the donors, and thus more easily have the food reach those who need it.</p>
