        <p>Care source is a project by students of Model Engineering College, Thrikkakara that aims to help those in need for food by providing them much needed philantrophic help.<br>
            Our aim is to bridge the gap between those who have excess food at their homes, and those who are in need of the above mentioned food.<br>
            
            Donors can donate the food by logging on to our website, and giving their contact information, location, and amount of available food so that our volunteers can reach them.<br>
            
            Volunteers can use the volunteers login to access the contact information of the donors, and thus more easily have the food reach those who need it.s</p>
